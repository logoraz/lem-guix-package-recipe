#+title: Lem Guix Package Recipe
#+author: Erik P Almaraz (logoraz)


** Background/Introduction

  - Original Work: https://github.com/Fuglesteg/lem-guix-packaging
  - Fork: https://github.com/arthur-dog/lem-guix-packaging
    - Based off of forked work.

  This is a Work In Progress (WIP). Once this has been tested more extensively and the TODO items
  below have been resolved, I plan to push this upstream to GNU Guix.

** Install

  Install/build using Guix shell (preferred Guix method):

  #+begin_src sh

    $ guix shell -m path/to/lem-package.scm

  #+end_src

  or install as a guix package install:

  #+begin_src sh

    $ guix package -f path/to/lem-package.scm

  #+end_src


** TODO (indefinitely on hold)
  - Development Environment Guix Package
  - Due to Lem's maintainers/contributors cantankerous negative attitutes towards Guix and unruly condescending comments towards new lispers, I am no longer interested in contributing to Lem in any way.
