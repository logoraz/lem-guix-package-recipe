# Background/Introduction

- Original Work: https://github.com/Fuglesteg/lem-guix-packaging
- Fork: https://github.com/arthur-dog/lem-guix-packaging
  - Based off of forked work.

This is a Work In Progress (WIP). Once this has been tested more extensively and the TODO items
below have been resolved, I plan to push this upstream to GNU Guix.

# Install

To build a local executable:

```

 $ guix package -f path/to/lem-package.scm

```

# TODO (indefinitely on hold)
- Development Environment Guix Package
- Due to Lem's maintainers/contributors cantankerous negative attitutes towards Guix and unruly
  condescending comments towards new lispers, I am no longer interested in contributing to Lem in any way.
